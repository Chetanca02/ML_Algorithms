### Characteristics of Regression
Here are the characteristics of the regression:
- Continuous Target Variable: Regression deals with predicting continuous target variables that represent numerical values. Examples include predicting house prices, forecasting sales figures, or estimating patient recovery times.
- Error Measurement: Regression models are evaluated based on their ability to minimize the error between the predicted and actual values of the target variable. Common error metrics include mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), and root mean squared error (RMSE).
Model Complexity: Regression models range from simple linear models to more complex nonlinear models. The choice of model complexity depends on the complexity of the relationship between the input features and the target variable.
Overfitting and Underfitting: Regression models are susceptible to overfitting and underfitting.
Interpretability: The interpretability of regression models varies depending on the algorithm used. Simple linear models are highly interpretable, while more complex models may be more difficult to interpret.

### Some terms
- Outliers: Observations with significantly low or high values compared to others, potentially impacting results and best avoided.
- Multicollinearity: High correlation among independent variables, which can complicate the ranking of influential variables.
- Underfitting and Overfitting: Overfitting occurs when an algorithm performs well on training but poorly on testing, while underfitting indicates poor performance on both datasets.
