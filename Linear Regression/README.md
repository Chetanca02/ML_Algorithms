### Introduction
Linear regression is a supervised machine-learning algorithm, that attempts to model the relationship between the dependent variable and one or more independent features by fitting a linear equation to observed data. by fitting a linear equation to observed data. For example, a modeler might want to relate the weights of individuals to their heights (and/or age) using a linear regression model.
Linear regression can also involve one variable (simple linear regression) or several variables (multiple linear regression) or be adapted for yes/no questions (logistic regression). When there is only one dependent variable, it is considered Univariate Linear Regression, while when there are more than one dependent variables, it is known as Multivariate Regression.
Linear regression fits a straight line or surface that minimizes the discrepancies between predicted and actual output values. 
Linear-regression models are relatively simple and provide an easy-to-interpret mathematical formula that can generate predictions. Linear regression can be applied to various areas in business and academic study. Because linear regression is a long-established statistical procedure, the properties of linear-regression models are well understood and can be trained very quickly.

#### Simple Linear Regression
Simple Linear Regression
This is the simplest form of linear regression, and it involves only one independent variable and one dependent variable. The equation for simple linear regression is:
Y = β$_{0}$ + β$_{1}$*X

where:
Y is the dependent variable
X is the independent variable
β<sub>0</sub>$ is the intercept
β</sub>1</sub> is the slope
