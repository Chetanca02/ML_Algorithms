# ML_Algorithms
Machine Learning is a branch of Artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that can learn from and make predictions on data.
The variable you want to predict is called the dependent variable. The variable you are using to predict the other variable's value is called the independent variable.
