## Introduction to Machine Learning
Machine Learning is a branch of Artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that can learn from and make predictions on data. The variable you want to predict is called the dependent variable. The variable you are using to predict the other variable's value is called the independent variable.

When it comes to using computer to perform tasks on behalf of humans, we always need to give instructions to the computer in form of a computer program. Most programming frameworks are about breaking down the main task into composable problems.
Traditional programming languages typically take data and (business or solution) rules as input and apply the rules to the data in order to come up with answers as output. For example, a traditionally programmed sales analysis application will read in sales data along with (business or sales) rules, and then apply those rules to the data and output the key trends, analytics or insights. Being a developer, one is always concerned about the logic or rules he/she writes to execute certain tasks.
On the other hand, in machine learning paradigm the data and answers (or labels) go in as input and the learned rules (models) come out as output. 
For a developer to switch into ML career path, he/she will require a change in mindset because in any ML problem they will be building models(not being explicitly programmed) which will predict the output based on the training dataset.

Artificial intelligence is about using data to impart human-like decision making to machines. AI is a science that studies ways to build intelligent programs and machines that can creatively solve problems, which has always been considered a human prerogative.
Machine learning is the study of computer algorithms that allow computer programs to automatically improve through experience. Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.
AI is different from Machine Learning, because it is working to create an intelligent system which can perform various complex tasks, whereas ML is working to create machines that can perform only those specific tasks for which they are trained.
Data science is a concept used to tackle big data and includes data cleansing, preparation, and analysis. A data scientist gathers data from multiple sources and applies machine learning, predictive analytics, and sentiment analysis to extract critical information from the collected data sets.
data science is the researching, building, and interpretation of the model you have built, while machine learning is the production of that model.
Overall, a data scientist can be many things, but the main functions are to:
- Meet with stakeholders to define the business problem
- Pull data
- EDA, feature engineering, model building, & prediction
- Depending on workplace, compile code to .py format and/or pickled model

When we talk about Deep Learning, we are talking about algorithms capable of mimicking the actions of the human brain thanks to neural networks, hence the term Artificial Intelligence. It is often explained that the difference between Machine Learning and Deep Learning is that Machine Learning algorithms will process quantitative and structured data (numeric values), while Deep Learning algorithms will process unstructured data, such as sound, text, image. So the difference is Feature Extraction. Although, Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning.
